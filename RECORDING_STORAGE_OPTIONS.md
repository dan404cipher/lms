# Recording Storage Options

## Option 1: Zoom Cloud Storage (Current Implementation)
**Pros:**
- No local storage needed
- Automatic processing
- Built-in CDN delivery
- No bandwidth costs for your server

**Cons:**
- Requires Zoom Pro/Business plan
- Dependent on Zoom service
- Limited customization

**Setup:**
- Already implemented in the system
- Recordings stay in Zoom cloud
- Users stream directly from Zoom

## Option 2: Download to Local Storage
**Pros:**
- Full control over recordings
- No dependency on Zoom after download
- Can implement custom video player

**Cons:**
- Requires significant storage space
- Bandwidth costs for serving videos
- Need to implement download automation

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Add to recording webhook handler
const downloadRecordingToLocal = async (recordingData) => {
  const response = await axios.get(recordingData.download_url, {
    responseType: 'stream',
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${zoomToken}` }
  });
  
  const filePath = `./uploads/recordings/${recordingData.id}.mp4`;
  const writer = fs.createWriteStream(filePath);
  response.data.pipe(writer);
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    writer.on('finish', resolve);
    writer.on('error', reject);
  });
};
```

## Option 3: AWS S3 Storage
**Pros:**
- Scalable cloud storage
- CDN integration
- Cost-effective
- Professional solution

**Cons:**
- Additional AWS costs
- More complex setup
- Need S3 configuration

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Add to recording webhook handler
const uploadToS3 = async (recordingData) => {
  // Download from Zoom
  const response = await axios.get(recordingData.download_url, {
    responseType: 'stream'
  });
  
  // Upload to S3
  const uploadParams = {
    Bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET,
    Key: `recordings/${recordingData.id}.mp4`,
    Body: response.data,
    ContentType: 'video/mp4'
  };
  
  const result = await s3.upload(uploadParams).promise();
  return result.Location;
};
```

## Recommendation
**Start with Option 1 (Zoom Cloud)** - it's already implemented and works perfectly for most use cases. You can always migrate to local/S3 storage later if needed.

## Current Storage Location
- **Recordings**: Zoom Cloud (streamed to users)
- **Metadata**: MongoDB database
- **Thumbnails**: Can be generated and stored locally
- **Transcripts**: Available through Zoom API
