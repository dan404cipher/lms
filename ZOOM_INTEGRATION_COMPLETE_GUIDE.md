```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Keep these credentials secure and never commit them to version control.

### Step 5: Scopes Configuration

Add the following scopes to your app:

#### Required Scopes:
- `meeting:write:admin` - Create and manage meetings
- `meeting:read:admin` - Read meeting information
- `recording:read:admin` - Access meeting recordings

## üîí Part 4: Environment Configuration

### Step 1: Update .env File

Add your Zoom credentials to `/api/.env`:

```env
# Zoom Integration Settings
ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# Optional: Legacy JWT (if still needed)
ZOOM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ZOOM_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# Webhook Settings
ZOOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN=your_webhook_secret_token
```

### Step 2: Verify Integration

Test your integration with a simple API call:

```bash
# Test API connection
curl -X GET "https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## üß™ Part 5: Testing Your Integration

### Test 1: Create Meeting

1. Create a session in your LMS
2. Check server logs for:
   ```
   Creating Zoom meeting with API...
   Zoom meeting created: [meeting details]
   ```
3. Verify meeting appears in your Zoom account

### Test 2: Start/Join Meeting

1. Start session as instructor
2. Should join as host with meeting controls
3. Have student join session
4. Should join as attendee without controls

### Test 3: Recording Processing

1. End a session after a few minutes
2. Check server logs for:
   ```
   Processing recordings for ended session...
   Successfully processed X recordings
   ```
3. Verify recording appears in LMS

### Test 4: Webhook Events

1. Monitor server logs during meeting lifecycle
2. Should see webhook events:
   ```
   Zoom webhook received: meeting.started
   Zoom webhook received: meeting.ended  
   Zoom webhook received: recording.completed
   ```

## üîß Part 6: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Invalid client credentials"
**Solution**: 
- Verify Account ID, Client ID, and Client Secret
- Ensure app is activated in Zoom marketplace
- Check for extra spaces or characters in .env file

#### Issue: "Insufficient privileges"
**Solution**:
- Add required scopes to your Zoom app
- Ensure your Zoom account has necessary permissions
- Verify app is published/activated

#### Issue: Webhook validation fails
**Solution**:
- Ensure your server is accessible from internet
- Check webhook endpoint responds to GET requests
- Verify webhook URL is correct (https required)

#### Issue: No recordings found
**Solution**:
- Cloud recording takes 2-5 minutes to process
- Check Zoom account recording settings
- Verify Pro/Business account (Basic doesn't support cloud recording)

#### Issue: Users join as attendees instead of host
**Solution**:
- Instructors should use startUrl (role=1)
- Students should use joinUrl (role=0)
- Check role assignment in join session logic

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Zoom API connectivity
curl -X POST https://zoom.us/oauth/token \
  -u "CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -d "grant_type=account_credentials&account_id=ACCOUNT_ID"

# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/sessions/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"endpoint.url_validation","payload":{"plainToken":"test"}}'

# Check meeting creation
curl -X GET "https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/me/meetings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## üìä Part 7: Monitoring and Maintenance

### Log Monitoring

Monitor these log patterns:

```bash
# Meeting creation
grep "Creating Zoom meeting" /var/log/lms-api.log

# Recording processing  
grep "Processing recordings" /var/log/lms-api.log

# Webhook events
grep "Zoom webhook received" /var/log/lms-api.log

# Errors
grep "Error.*Zoom" /var/log/lms-api.log
```

### Performance Metrics

Track these metrics:
- Meeting creation success rate
- Recording processing time
- Webhook delivery success rate
- API rate limit usage

### Regular Maintenance

#### Monthly:
- Review recording storage usage
- Check for failed webhook deliveries
- Verify app credentials haven't expired

#### Quarterly:
- Review and update scopes if needed
- Check for new Zoom API features
- Update integration documentation

## üîê Part 8: Security Best Practices

### Credential Management

1. **Environment Variables**: Store all secrets in .env files
2. **Secret Rotation**: Rotate client secrets regularly
3. **Access Control**: Limit who has access to Zoom credentials
4. **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive data

### Webhook Security

1. **Verify Requests**: Validate webhook signatures
2. **HTTPS Only**: Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints  
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints
4. **IP Filtering**: Whitelist Zoom IP ranges if possible

### Meeting Security

1. **Waiting Rooms**: Enable for sensitive meetings
2. **Passwords**: Require meeting passwords
3. **Recording Permissions**: Control who can access recordings
4. **Participant Management**: Monitor meeting participants
